        "description": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) affects a significant portion of individuals with psoriasis, yet early identification remains a challenge in clinical practice. The PRESTO-PsA tool was developed as part of an ongoing research initiative to help bridge this gap by providing physicians with a simple, scalable method to estimate the risk of PsA development over 1-year or 5-year periods.\n\nThis app is designed to support clinical awareness and stimulate further investigation. By inputting patient information, users can generate a risk estimate based on validated prediction models. While the app does not provide diagnostic guidance or score interpretation at this stage, it serves as a valuable research tool to facilitate early risk recognition and prompt consideration for further evaluation or rheumatology referral.",
